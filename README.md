# Data-Exploration---Customer-Segmentation-Project

The preceding affords a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis of Newco Telecom with the primary intent in defining segments based upon overall customer value.   Both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification were utilized for segmentation using key feature variables, including age, education/employment status, individual income and average user revenue.    It was determined that clustering via k-means afforded a more accurate and reliable segmentation outcome.

The project successfully identified three customer segments distinguished by value and allowed for a full characterization of each customer segmentation.   The results thus allow for more targeted and thus more lucratuve marketing campaigns to high value segments.  Addtionally,  we were successful in identifying the key characteristics of customer segments most prone to churn.
